I use social media extremely frequently, so I am already very familiar with mose social media platforms. The ones that interested me the most were instagram, twitter, and snapchat. Instagram was an applciation that I used frequently in the past, around middle and high school, but I stopped during high school since my friend group became smaller and I became more reserved
in my online presence. I also didn't like the culture within instagram, as it was very self-centered and leaned towards values that I didn't think highly of. I instead began to use Snapchat, which I find superior for interpersonal relationships. The messaging system is more streamlined and is more effective between individuals, while still having many similar featuers to instagram.
Twitter is the platform I have began to use most recently, sicne I have many friends online that frequent twitter. Twitter is a more public space, and that is part of the reason why Twitter accounts are less tied to peoples real life identities, which is a big selling point to the platform.
Most of my experience on social media is through recreation, but I have seen it used frequently for business. I know many people that manage social media accounts for their employers, and it is a very delicate job to manage the social media account for a corporation.

Facebook supports many of the honeycomb framework elements effectively. Your identity on Facebook is well-protected, conversations are enabled, sharing is thorough, and relationships are well-detailed. Its groups are by far the most effecive, as Facebook groups are centerplace for many communities, including hobbyists, parents for specific neighborhoods/schools, and many more. However, it lacks the reputation of a popular platform, especially in recent years, as young people rarely use Facebook. Your presence on facebook is also lacking, since you cannot see the immediate activity of others outside of instant messaging. Twitter by far embodies each element the best, since the Twitter experience is inherently tied to individuality and how you interact with others, with most activity being on public posts, but still having the capability to directly message other users.
