As a part of assignment 1, I researched IP addresses, what their purposes are, and how their uses could affect me. I learned that IP stands for internet protocol, and that is is used to identify a piece of networked hardware and allow it to communicate across a network, such as the internet.
As a part of the internet, IP addresses in a database called a DNS server that translates the hostname of the website you are trying to access and finds its IP address so that you can connect to the website. Users can change their DNS settings to 
have faster access times, or switch to a company that they trust more with their data. You can actually look up the ip addresses of the websites you access, your own IP address, and even the DNS server you are connected to. In the future I can use what I learned through my research to ensure my data is secure
and my web browsing is optimized.

I also researched how computers organize your applications and files. I never knew that there were file types that are hidden by your computer, and now that I have disabled that in my windows settings I can access folders that I needed to reach through command prompt. In the future, I'll be able to access files on my computer easier, notably in the appdata folder, since that was hidden by my system prior. I also learned about all sorts of shortcuts, some of which I already knew, such as quickly clicking the left mouse button several times to highlight, but I never knew what any of they keys such as "Home" and "End" did, so now I can use those to make my work even faster.
