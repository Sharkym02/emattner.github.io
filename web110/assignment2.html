        My research for this assignment led me to try Opera as a new web browser. While it still uses Google as a search engine, it has many features that Google does not have, such as sidebar apps, a built-in music player, and limits its usage while using other apps to ensure
your other apps run smoothly. However, even with all of these features, I will still most likely continue using Chrome because of its connectivity with my phone, where I also use Chrome, as well as Chrome's integrations with my Google account and its plugins that I use very frequently. While others have concerns about privacy for each browser, I do not share these concerns, therefore they did not have much of an effect on my decision to continue using Chrome.

Even before starting the assignment, I had several utility extensions installed onto my Chrome browser, such as an ad blocker, and several that apply a "dark mode" filter to certain webpages. I also have some for recreational purposes, such as identifying any song that's playing inside of the browser, putting a picture of Rick Astley next to any link to the music video for "Never gonna give you up" so I don't get rickrolled, and adding more emoticons for chat rooms in a streaming website. 

One aspect of web browsers I didn't know nearly as much about was URL's and their prefixes. The most common prefix, HTTP, or hypertext transfer protocol, transmits HTML(hypertext markup langauge) webpages, which can supply almost any kind of content, including text, images, video, and applications. HTTPS is simply a more secure version of HTTP. One thing I learned is that www is not a mandatory part of webpages, its simply such a ubiquitous internet application that many web browsers simply assume that the webpage you are accessing is a part of the world wide web.
