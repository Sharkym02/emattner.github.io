    WEB110 Assignment 9

<main>
    <p>
        While completing these activities, I learned how to link websites to each other within their own system as well as to outside entities. This will be incredibly vital in the future since nearly all websites have links to other portions of the website and/or network. I also learned about html and it's tags, specifically the meta tags, which I had to create from scratch for these activites.
