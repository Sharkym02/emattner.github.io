        As a part of my internship, I worked with many different kinds of networks for many clients. I installed several using server racks, connected them to switches and wiring the switches to essential machines that needed the most consistent and quickest connection possible. Even though I was installing entire networks, I never learned about the inner workings of the machines I was installing. Learning about the different layers of networks, link, internet, transport, and application, as well as the different types of networks, such as LAN, WAN, and VPN, will help me greatly in my future career, especially if I continue to work in the IT industry. I was very interested in the concept of a protocol stack, since my computer science background already has worked with many kinds of stacks in the past. 

I was also intrigued by the different styles of networks layouts, between bus, ring, and star topology, I didn't know there were so many unique ways to design your network. My internship only ever used star topology in our networks, but I'm eager to try other designs and evaluate their effectiveness compared to my previous work. 

While I was already familiar with most of the networking hardware, I haven't used some of them, such as hubs and modems, in favor of routers and switches. For my personal networks, routers have been my go-to because of their ease of use and because I mainly use a Wi-Fi connection, while switches were often used for more advanced systems that I set up during my internship.
