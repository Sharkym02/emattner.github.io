    WEB110 Assignment 10
<main>
    <p>
        This assignment taught me how to create cascading style sheets, or CSS, in HTML. CSS are integral to creating webpages since it allows you to create webpages that aren't simply black paragraphs on a white background. You can make your webpages colorful, sleek, and pleasing to the eye.
        Every webpage, even the most simple ones, have some sort of styling to them, even if you don't think of it when you view them. Even something as simple as changing the size of the font is performed by CSS. Every HTMl webpage I ever create will contain CSS, so it's very important to create a good foundation of understanding for the subject.
