As a part of my internship over the summer, I frequently used remote desktop applications to operate on clients' machines. While we used an application called Splashtop SOS instead of built-in Microsoft services, much of its usage is the same. Knowing how to effectively utilize remote access to computers is extremely helpful to individuals such as myself that frequently have to work on machines that they don't have near them physically. It's also important to know the security risks this type of service poses. Ensuring that both the person remotely accessing the local machine and the local user have no intention to attack each other through their connection is essential to internet safety. 

VoIP is a new term that I learned through my research for this assignment. I didn't know that there was a different between VoIP and normal phone calls, I previously thought they worked essentially the same way. This is helpful to me, since I use many VoIP services, such as Skype, WhatsApp and Snapchat in my day-to-day activities. I even used Skype for some business interactions, so making sure I know how they work will be helpful in the future.
