        Learnings
        <p>
            For this assignment, I learned how to embed many media elements into my websites, as well as the differences between different file types for the same media elements(e.g. mp4 vs mp3 vs wav). Knowing which file type is optimal for my use will come very handy in the future. However, embedding these elements into my websites will be even more important, since these will be incorporated into every website I will create.
