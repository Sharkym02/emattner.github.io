Out of the four search engines I used during this assignment, Google was by far my favorite. Its interface is sleek, simple, and effective at displaying relevant results. Microsoft Bing looks very similar to Google but has a bit of clutter, showing a lot of unnecessary information that is entirely unrelated to my search. Yahoo's layout is much nicer on the eyes, but still has some Bing-like clutter, and emphasizes heavily on news articles, which is likely a design choice for a different audience, possibly older users who more actively read about world happenings. Ask is by far my least favorite, as the first search results is nearly halfway down the webpage, and the very top of the page is filled with ads and suggested searches. The home page for both Ask and Yahoo look very dated, which makes me want to use them much less. 

Before now, I never knew that you could search for exact phrases, search throughout specific websites, search with boolean operations, etc. I would often just use more and more specific words in my search to find what I want, but these new techniques will help me a lot in my internet browsing. For example, if I am researching about a very specific historical event, and google can't find anything specific about it, but it does point me towards useful websites that could have tangential information, I could search inside of that specific website and find some information not directly related, but still useful.

Search Engine Optimization actually something I'm quite familar with, since I spent some of my time during my internship on making my employer's website more accessible to the public/customers. I spent a lot of time fixing the metadata so that it would show up more for potential customers in the relevant geographical areas, as well as updating the information that showed on the search engines under the link, and made it more appealing to those who were just glancing around Google.
