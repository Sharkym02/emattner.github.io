        I like to believe that my internet usage is as safe as it can be, but I've learned that I still am vulnerable to many types of attacks. Some of the applications and files that I download are shady at times, but thankfully I have yet to have issues because of this. In the future I will be sure to be more careful of the file that I install from the web. 

Browser security is not a concept that I had heard of previously, but it seems very important now that it's been brought to my attention. I never viewed my web browser as an object that could be attacked, and me through it, but it's very possible for bad actors to use browsers as a medium to get to you and your information, even through something like incognito or private mode. My add-on suite will likely diminish in the future, especially add-ons that ask for extra data from your computer or stored, personally identifying information from websites that I frequent.
