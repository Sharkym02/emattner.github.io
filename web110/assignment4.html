I have used gmail ever since I made my first email account in first grade, which I still use to this day. In lieu of using a specific mail application, I simply use the web app for gmail in my browser. I find this much more convenient than having an entire computer application for sending/checking emails, especially because Google services are embedded so seamlessly into the Chrome browser. After briefly trying Mozilla Thunderbird, I would rather continue using the Gmail web app, or switch to outlook, which has a similar layout but is used more often in professional applications and has more compatibility with windows operating systems due to being developed by Microsoft.

After researching the inner workings of email services, such as email clients, servers, and how they connect and interact with each other, I learned of many protocols which are used for sending/retrieving emails to and from the servers. However, even with all these special protocols and clients that are used for email, many of them have been used far less in favor of web-based platforms, such as how I use the Gmail web application. Using the mailto: prefix in your browser URL box is a cool integration of the previous lesson in the current one, combining your search engine with your email program on your computer. 

I have never signed up for mailing lists, and I don't see myself signing up for any in the future. I rarely check my emails if I'm not excepting anything, and they would most likely make my already cluttered inbox more difficult to navigate. However, I have had many teachers/professors in the past show me many interesting pieces of news and updates in their field that they found out about through one of their email lists that they sign up for. This is another piece of media that is likely tailored for older individuals, who are more experienced with signing up for receiving physical mail than the younger generation who is more accustomed to the internet.
